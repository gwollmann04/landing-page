## General information:

Project made using NextJS, TypeScript and ChakraUI in order to my personal landing page.

It's a responsive interface to visualize a little bit about me, my career, education and more.

It is possible to play a game that I developed during a course and it is also connected with an API for sending emails that can be used through the form at the bottom of the page.
