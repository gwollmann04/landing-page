      `I have been using React for almost two years in my current job, and even longer for personal projects such as my master's thesis, where I developed the web component using React.
      
      In addition, several short courses that I attended and small projects developed during courses were using this technology.
      
      I have also explored other technologies like Vue, Angular, and ReactNative through personal projects, such as my final graduation project. While I am still new to these technologies, I chose not to post topics related to them.
      
      Although I enjoy using React for development, I am continually learning and exploring other libraries and frameworks.`,

    value: `I've been in contact with JavaScript for about 5 years, where I started to study the area of web development, since then I've had contact with technology in some different contexts.
    
    During my time at Moblize, I used JavaScript to develop systems that could seamlessly integrate with hardware and embedded systems. Additionally, I developed systems to connect with embedded systems for both my graduation final paper and master's dissertation, which I had to integrate with a web interface.
    
    I have also completed personal projects focused solely on web and mobile development without hardware integration. Currently, I work as a frontend developer, where I use JavaScript on a daily basis while working with React.`,

    value: `While I started my career in web development using JavaScript, I have developed a strong preference for TypeScript due to the significant benefits it offers. 
    
    Despite the complexity associated with using this superset of JavaScript, it generates more solid code that can prevent many common errors, such as incorrect variable assignments.
    
    During my almost 2 years in my current job, I have exclusively used NextJS for projects and TypeScript as my primary language. Through this experience, I have come to believe that TypeScript significantly increases productivity compared to using pure JavaScript.
    
    Although typing errors can be frustrating when first working with TypeScript, I have discovered that using the any type is powerful ally when testing and prototyping quickly before defining types correctly.`,

    value: `I've been working with CSS for several years now, alongside JavaScript and HTML. One premise that I believe about this technology is that: it's great when it works.
    
    I've encountered many people who have been frustrated when using CSS, especially when trying to center an item or apply spacing. When I first started using CSS, it felt overwhelming with so many options to choose from, making it challenging to decide which one to use.
    
    However, with practice, I've become much more comfortable using CSS and the other tools. I still have a lot to learn, but I know that it will become easier as I continue to practice and gain experience.
    
    I am especially fascinated by the possibilities that CSS offers, including animations. I'm always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and learn about best practices.`,

    I have been in contact with this technology for several years now, since I took my first course on JavaScript and web development, around 2018.
    
    Even though I use many component libraries for development, I enjoy deepening my understanding of the elements that make up the page structure. Having syntactically sound code makes development much easier.
    
    I believe that applying good syntax in code is a vital aspect of building well-structured code. Even when using components from libraries, I try always to use or create components that fit the syntactic context where they are inserted.`,

    value: `I have always been passionate about playing video games, but while I enjoy popular titles like GTA, Dark Souls, World of Warcraft, and Call of Duty, I tend to gravitate towards indie games, especially those with 2D graphics and pixel art.
    
    My fascination with video games led me to imagine what it would be like to create my own game. The complexity of making objects move, animating assets, and applying physics correctly always intrigued me.
    
    To learn more about the game development process, I enrolled in a course on developing 2D games using Unity. There, I used C# to create a game that you can check out via the link below.
    
    Though it is a simple game, the experience of going through the development process was incredible, and it motivated me to learn more about pixel art and how to make the assets of my own game.
    
    While the project is currently on hold, I have already written a significant portion of the story. Who knows, maybe one day it will come to fruition.`,
