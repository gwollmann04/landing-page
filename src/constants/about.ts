      `I've been using React for almost 2 years in my current job, but I've been using it longer for personal projects, such as my master's dissertation which had its web part developed using React.
      
      In addition, several short courses that I attended and small projects developed during courses were using this technology.
      
      I've also done some small personal projects in Vue, like my final college project, Angular and ReactNative, but as I'm still very new to these technologies, so I chose not to post topics related to them.
      
      And although I really enjoy using React for development, I'm also learning these and many other libraries and frameworks.`,
